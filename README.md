Serverless URL Shortener

About the Project:
A fully serverless URL shortener built using Cloudflare Workers and Workers KV. The entire app runs at Cloudflare’s edge — no servers, no backend setup. A single Worker script generates short links, stores them in KV, and handles instant redirects worldwide. This project helped me understand edge computing, KV storage, API routing, and real cloud deployment.
